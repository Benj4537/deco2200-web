                <p>As a group, I first come up with the idea that an autonomous device that able to clean garbage near the coast, and with the function of salvage. However, this idea was denied for lack of access to relevant expert and device with similar function has been existed. The second idea was an autonomous vehicle that able to autonomously load cargo and shipping within the industrial zone, but due to issues on the policy of transportation and interview problem, it’s been denied as well.

After that, we focus on an area that is closer to daily life, and in this way, we might get insight and useful interview data or user feedback in the

                <p>future work. The idea of designing interface to control an autonomous shopping cart that would follow user while shopping or could take the user to find items was come up from our group discussion in week 2 studio. This was a perfect idea so far because of its flexibility and essay access to the participants and relevant worker. Similar existing product found such as the shopping cart developed by Technion-Israel Institute of Technology students, with ability to track the user by using 3D Kinect sensor & 3D camera and Amazon Warehouse Robots that able to perform task itself in a big and organized warehouse.
                Background research did towards the public survey of supermarket satisfaction rating, it is important because it gave me an overall trend of how people feel and what a ranked layer of factors that we should be focusing on.
                The workload was divided into 1/3 approximately to each our group member, I did go to IKEA that week for observation; space mapping and interview. Its Friday afternoon, I wasn’t expecting that much people at that time (because there even weren’t that many people in IKEA at weekend), however, the observation and space mapping had been great. The man showing up in the interview video, we met each other in IKEA (and we met once before, he was an economy student in USYD), glad he let me recording this video, with rest of participants for my interview, I come up with the following trend：
                -    people who went to the supermarket more often tend to have lower patience when facing stuff inaccessible, poor or changed layout of items;
                -    youth go online shopping for more category and items that unavailable in store;
                -    people go physically shopping with friends, family in a shopping mall usually once per month, and expecting a good experience overall;
                -    A massive number of issues exist when people shopping indoor, and some of them are not avoidable.
                I was going to interview workers in IKEA and probably stuff in the supermarket, but unable to. Instead, I put my attention on user behavior preference and factors that might have a negative impact on user shopping experience. Through observation I found:
                -    Most important how items categorized and organized, especially for a place in a big environment and multiple floors like IKEA;
                -    an obvious problem of accessibility of stuff, most stuff around the 1st floor, causing poor accessibility on the second floor;
                -    international students, they visit more frequently to buy big furniture and most of them do not drive.
                For part of those research finding and concern, we finally narrow down our device function to finding items at end of week 3.

                Reflection:  The idea was overall satisfied through thoughtful consideration, we were able to get into the market and get touch with the user during the process, but I’m expecting more efficient ideation next time. In terms of customer interview an expert interview, it requires well planned before I get into the market to do an interview. For example, email relevant stuff or try to communicate with them, might be I can get a chance to interview them after work. This was part of research skill that I am supposed to develop through my study as well, so next time make sure I plan well first. Besides, I might try to apply some more research methods in this stage, so I get useful data to form various aspects.

                <p>Finally, we were able to work as a group, but now dissension block on our way. Most time of group work we were arguing about what should be taken in consideration and what shouldn’t, and which consideration is necessary, and which is not, we all had a different opinion rather than focusing on user requirement and feedback. For instance, weather should autonomous cart follow the user and give control to the user or should it take the user to the destination. We kept asking this question, and it was a trick question because people from different country have different shopping style (of course different age group, but we were no considering it cause my group member to suggest that we are focusing on teenagers, so we were able to narrow down our target), and it also decide what extent should our interface go into certain aspect of shopping. or why don’t we apply both, it makes user confused about device function after we texted. However, it’s important to focus on screen interaction, and fortunately, we were able to realize this.

Within two concepts of the autonomous shopping cart (follow the user and autonomously navigating), I was started sketch wireframe in week 5 based on scenarios that Shirley made for concept 2, and some screens that focus on specific functionality for the purpose of testing with the user. To make a low-fidelity paper prototype, I was wondering to add a robot face somewhere in the screen to make autonomous shopping cart more friendly and technological, but it seems simply add a facial expression screen would not make sense after later we texted with the user. The screens I made later was clear and simple for most participants, and function was as simple as searching for item and navigation, and this is where we made most changes after. There are plenty of things to talk about in terms of evolution, overall it can be classified as follows:
-    while some participants prefer to follow trolley, many claimed that it makes them felt less control;
-    unclear interaction demonstrated like how to cancel items;
-    less shopping experience gained through following autonomous cart;
-    feedback concerned about the feasibility of autonomous cart in terms of technology;
-    flexibility, what happens if they changed mind while navigation;
-    the freshness detect function is hardly useful (few claimed it was useless).

For another prototype from the different concept that Jack did (autonomous cart the following the user, a user operating and navigating through mobile app), I saw many participants were confused about interface and functions. This might be caused by bad hand drawing; however, our interface also has plenty of misleading buttons; fields not proportional well within one screen; and most important we didn’t connect multiple screens through a logical way.

Generally, those are what the user felt when they first use our interface, it was helpful to us to know that this concept works, but we need to dig into it. So, we interview few users for more feedback, and it appears extremely helpful:

-    If the item is out of stock, users need to know previously otherwise they can’t find it after navigation.
-    Might be we should figure out how fruit and vegetable are going to be weighted.
-    Make a list before shopping could make shopping more efficiently.
-    Considering how to make shopping more flexible through differentiate interaction on the screen.
-    And it could be more efficient if the device can navigate multiple goods in one route.

After we took user feedback through careful consideration, we did apply some functionality which was necessary through the shopping experience and leaves few technological issues for the autonomous device itself in a reasonable way. Luckily, some user requirements matched with the ideas that I draw previously. So, I was able to optimums screen and connect them successfully.

Reflection:  Just like I mentioned before I learned from usability testing, what I had done well is think like the user when I develop my idea including built screen and user flow; always ask for more feedback from the user if possible. Others were about group work, I want to make sure next time I have more efficient communication with group members.

Instead of starting to add a connection center (home page) and all necessary screen that needs at the moment, I started with asking feedback to form a few users with the digital prototype that we made in last few weeks. The purpose is to find out user requirements through a simulative shopping experience, and it did appear to be there still many expectations in terms of function towards this autonomous shopping cart and interface itself to be more realistic. Simply concluding usability texting as following:</p>

                <p>-    I want more choice as if I can do physically;
-    There are too many screens, I want shopping as simple as possible;
-    If there is a function button, make sure it has obvious interaction or connected with another screen;
-    I was expecting a cooler interface design;
-    I want to go back and forth whenever I am using this application.

Overall, the user always wants more realistic and personalized experience, however, we could not satisfy all user needs otherwise it becomes too complex. So, with current feedback and intention of optimizing the main process, I made plenty of changes in terms of style, button, navigation, and functionality. I want to talk a little bit more about major changes on the interface and why. Reason for changing original classic white and blue style to mainly grey, white plus green. White and blue was not doing a great job to attract the user, grey in the home page now create more contrast for button and icons on the screen. I used green on individual text and edge of the button rather than the whole button, the reason for that is green play a major role of emphasis, too much green would have a negative effect. Another major change was on the home page divided equally by fields making a shopping list and start shopping demonstrated with a big icon, and it is to implement user expectation of improving shopping efficiency and flexibility. The part pre-enter shopping list wasn’t that much about interaction improvement, but it differentiates the flow of screen, so the user is easier to understand when first time uses it, and it proved in later texting as well.

Unfortunately, when I finally get all the sketches done and putting them into inversion, I found it was frustrated. It was 20 minutes work in my mind but go back and forth from screen to screen was not going well. I thought it might be technical issues (and obviously there was some), I went back to sketch and create more screen in order to match up with the flow. This happens again and again until I started to doubt that element, the button on the screen did not design well to connect between them. We had a discussion about this and choose not to connect all the page due to too much workload, and this interface is just enough in terms of prototype although there are still bugs and defects exist, we do not have enough time to work on it.

However, even though I made special consideration on the flow of screen, it did not reach my expectation. Though we are not required to connect the whole interface every bottom and fields, I personally expect smoother flow over the screen, and obviously, we can still refine the work in terms of usability. I’m expecting more attention on the main part of the future assessment (as I always mislead the way by other parts, which is not a good habit) obviously to develop more hard skills relevant to work is necessary, as this time I could use Framer to build a more attractive prototype.
